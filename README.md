# 📺 Netflix Data Analysis Project

This project performs basic data analysis and visualization on a small Netflix dataset to explore the content distribution by type, country, and movie durations.

## 🧠 Why I built this?

As someone passionate about both data science and entertainment content, I wanted to dive into Netflix's content data to extract patterns in content type, movie durations, and country-wise content trends. This mini-project helped me practice data cleaning, manipulation, and visualization using Python libraries like `Pandas` and `Matplotlib`.
